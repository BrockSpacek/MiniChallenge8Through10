Mini Challenges 8-10
Description: Completed 3 Endpoint challenges using services and controllers to build a magic 8 ball game, a guessing number game, and a random restaraunt picker!

Peer Review: Bowen Henry: All of your code looks good man. The only thing I would change is the name of your controllers and services so they are the same as what the assignment is.
